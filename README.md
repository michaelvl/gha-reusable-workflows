# GitHub Reusable Workflows

This repository have reusable workflows for building a SLSA level 3
secure software supply chain.

See e.g. [SLSA Supply chain threats](https://slsa.dev/spec/v1.0/threats-overview):

See also [example application pository](https://github.com/michaelvl/sigstore-in-toto-workshop).

## Protections

Note, that SLSA focus on the build-phase and does not cover source,
i.e. tampering with the source prior to building.
